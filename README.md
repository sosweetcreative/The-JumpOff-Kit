# The Jumpoff
A Codekit project starter and front-end framework


## What's That Now?
Oh, just a little project starter I use for basic front-end work. It contains all them common ui elements, a proportional grid & typographic system, some js stuff I use a good bit, SCSS configs and mixins (with Bourbon), and so on. More than that, The Jumpoff contains a project structure of scss, js, and shared include files that I've found works well in CodeKit and beyond.


## You Gonna Document It Proper Like?
Maybe one of these days. This is more for me.
